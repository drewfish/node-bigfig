Contributing Code to Bigfig
---------------------------
Pull requests are very welcome, but should be within the scope of the project
and follow the repository's code conventions. Before submitting a pull request
it's helpful to file an issue, so we can discuss the intent and approach of
the proposed change.

Please be sure to sign our [CLA][] before you submit a pull request or
otherwise contribute to Bigfig. Here's the CLA's human-readable summary:
> You are saying that you have the right to give us this code, which is either
> your own code, or code that your company allows you to publish. You want to
> give us this code. We may decide to use this code. You are not going to sue
> people who use this code, because, after all, you are giving it to an open
> source project! And if you include code that you didn't write, you'll tell
> us about it by including the open source license to such code in your
> contribution so we'll know about it. You are not promising that this code
> works well, or that you will support it, and we're OK with that.
